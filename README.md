This repository contains code and resources for the Visual GeoLocalization project, including data cleaning scripts,  and model implementations like VGG16 and SIFT.

## Files
- `clean_data.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for tracking the user's path.
- `SIFT.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for implementing Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for image matching.
- `VGG16.py`: Python script that implements the VGG16 model for deep learning tasks.

## Missing Files
Some large files were not added to this repository due to GitHub's size restrictions such as `road_type_classifier2.keras` for road junction classification : X-jucntion, T-junction Y-junction and roundabouts
